          <h3>Java</h3>
          <p>
            As a part of my university curriculum I had undergone 1 year of
            complex studying Java. I have implemented a couple of applications
            in a team environment that include a cake store management system
            (yum) and a project management system both build on a famous UI
            Library called JavaFX.

          <h3>C#</h3>
          <p>
            Similarly to Java I studied C# in university as well as during the
            last year of high school. I have broad knownledge in ASP.NET Core
            which includes working with Blazor and ASP.NET Web REST APIs.
            Particular project I have worked on in this area is a shared
            calendar created for the user to be organized and also be touch with
            friends or family.

          <h3>C++</h3>
          <p>
            My first ever program and first ever encounter with coding and
            proramming was in C++. I have attended dozen of national
            competitions related to competitive programming with C++ during my
            years in middle school (5th to 8th grade). Since than I have
            neglected C++ a lot but one would never know when a skill could come
            in handy!
